# base16-onedark-scheme
Contains colors for base16 scheme generation for onedark theme. This is based on the onedark.vim project (https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) as well as the onedark iTerm project (https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal) with both of those drawing inspiration from the default Atom theme.
